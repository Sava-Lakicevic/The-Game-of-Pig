# The-Game-of-Pig
This project implements the game of pig, otherwise known as the pig game. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
 - If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
 - If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.
 - If a player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
 
 The first player to 100 (or more) wins.
